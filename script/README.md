This is a simple script to convert a dialogue tree drawn in Omnigraffle into a dialogue text file. 

To use:

    macruby graffle2dialogue.rb

This will input the drawing at dialogue.graffle and output dialogue.txt.

Personally I think editing the textfile directly is far easier than messing around in Omnigraffle, but not all dialogue editors would agree...
